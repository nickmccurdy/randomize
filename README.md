=======================================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicolasmccurdy/randomize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicolasmccurdy/randomize)

A simple web app for generating random data.

Goals
-----

- Simple UI, offering common use cases (dice, coins, etc.) along with more configurable alternatives.
- Make it clear what the settings were for all results.
- Mobile friendly UI.
- Focus on fast results with PRNGs, instead of using a more accurate source of randomness.
